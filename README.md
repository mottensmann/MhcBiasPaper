'The effect of using internal primers on estimates of MHC diversity among mammals'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Meinolf Ottensmann, Jan Sauer & Joseph I. Hoffman

*Under development!*

Many studies examining variation at mammalian MHC class II loci have been using primers that bind within the second exon, the probably most polymorphic region of the vertebrate genome. Here, we analysed how this may have an effect on estimates of genetic diverstiy at the DQB locus by combining a case study of Antarctic fur seals (*Arctocephalus gazella*) with a meta-analysis incorporating many more taxa.

### Overview of the repository content

*The raw data of the paired-end sequencing is not included as may be downloaded from (LINK) and saves as `reads1.fastq.gz` & `reads2.fastq.gz` within the subfolder `MiSeq\raw-reads`*

-   **`R_code.pdf`** & **`R_code.Rmd`** contain the documented code for all analyses presented in the manuscript.
-   **`blast\db`**: Locally compiled NCBI Blast databases will be created here
-   **`blast\seq`**: Fasta sequences downloaded from NCBI Genbank will be deposited here
-   **`blast\hits`**: Hits returned by blasting sequences to databases
-   **`data`**: Raw data files needed to rerun analyses.
-   **`MiSeq`**: Raw sequencing reads as well as sequences generated during processing the sequencing data
-   **`R`**: Functions required for analysis
